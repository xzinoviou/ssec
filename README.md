# ssec

A Spring Boot - Spring Security project for quick development process.

Initially it includes only one branch with Basic Authentication so you can run the project immediately and is configured with a stateless policy.
This setup includes a controller loaded up with resources in order to build the project the way you want it.

You are advised to implement a proper authentication mechanism (ldap,jwt, etc..) if you are to use this as a backbone for serious development purposes.

More branches will be added to showcase different approaches
 
So , just clone it and start building!
